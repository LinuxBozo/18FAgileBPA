## Approach Criteria Evidence
|    | RFQ Section 24.A - Development Pool  | Evidence |
|----|--------------------------------------|----------|
| a  | Assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted |          |
| b  | Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum of two of the labor categories limited to the Development Pool labor categories to develop the prototype as quoted in Attachment C |          |
| c  | Used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.) |          |
| d  | Deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used |          |
| e  | Wrote unit tests for their code |          |
| f  | Set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider |          |
| g  | Set up or used configuration management |          |
| h  | Set up or used continuous monitoring |          |
| i  | Deploy their software in a container (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization) |         |
| j  | Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype |          |
| k  | Provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine |          |
| l  | Prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge |          |
